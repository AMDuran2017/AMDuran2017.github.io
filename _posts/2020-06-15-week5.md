title: Week 5

I started the week attempting to run all of the cloned repositories on the Rover server, but all of them failed dues to Rover not having a GPU installed.
The rest of the week was spent transfering me over to the Boson sevrer and installing of of the software required to run these repositoies.
I was able to get the AlpfaFold remake, "Minifold" about to load its model.
