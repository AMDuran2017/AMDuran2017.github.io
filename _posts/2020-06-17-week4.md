I investigated an open source replication of DeepMind's Alfpafold. 
I also found and examined an open source competition to discover potentially helpful drugs to combat Covid-19.
In this competition, the winners created AIs to generate novel drug molecules and then evaluate these molecules based on how well
they could bind to the novel coronavirus.
These repos were cloned to the Rover server in hopes of analysing their techniques and applying them to our project.
