Searched internet for various projects conserning the current COVID-19 pendemic and how computers are being used to model the disease.
Catagorized these projects, deturmined their usefulness, and found their source code.
i focus on projects that attempted to model the spread of the disease and how different social behaviors affect these models.
shared what was found with rest of the research team
