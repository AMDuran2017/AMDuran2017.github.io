title: Week 6
---

After getting minifold to load its model file last week, the challenge for this week was to getting it to utilize it to recreate the predictionso it claimed. 
This difficultly was largely due to the program being build on CUDA 9.0 while the boson server only ran CUDA 10.0, and a lot of the used python libraries were incompatible with this new update.
After createing several envirments and testing what module updates could be installed with breaking the program, i finally got Minifold fully up and running, recreating the results decriped in its readme.
