title: Week 5
---

I started the week attempting to run all of the cloned repositories on the Rover server, but I was recommended to switch to the Boson server as Rover did not have a installed GPU, which would be utilized to run the code from the repositories.
The rest of the week was spent transfering me over to the Boson server and installing some of the software required to run these source codes.
By the end of the week, I was able to get the AlpfaFold remake, "Minifold" able to load its model.
