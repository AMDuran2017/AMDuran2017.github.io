title: Week 5

I started the week attempting to run all of the cloned repositories on the Rover server, but all of them failed dues to Rover not having a GPU installed.
The rest of the week was spent transfering me over to the Boson server and installing some of the software required to run these repositories.
By the end of the week, I was able to get the AlpfaFold remake, "Minifold" able to load its model.
