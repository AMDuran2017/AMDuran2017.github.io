title: Week 7

This week my goal was to get the rest of the source codes up and working. For each of these sources a new virtual environment was created to isolate the individual requirements.
with the remaing time For this project growing shorter, the orginal scope of the original goal was reduced and the goal was refined to: Investigate how High Performance Computing has influenced humanity's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Most of my focus was on working on and understanding the [Deep Learning Covid Cure source code created by Matt O'Connor](https://github.com/mattroconnor/deep_learning_coronavirus_cure).
The main reason for this focus is this program showed that Remdisiver was the potentially good drug to fight COVID-19, and this drug has since been under clinical trails and is showing promising results to this day.
