This week started with my initial meeting with research mentor Dr. Hyesoon Kim, PhD student Euna, and research partner Nia Blake.
We were shown an overview of how research is generally conducted. We also defined  the goals and vision for the project:
The goal of this project is to investigate how High performance computing has influenced humanities response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We then established a timeline for our project and began investigating the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium and their various projects.
