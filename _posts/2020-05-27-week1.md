This week started with my initial meeting with research mentor Dr. Hyesoon Kim, PhD student Euna, and research partner Nia Blake.
We were shown an overview of how research is generally conducted. We also defined the goals and vision for the project:
The goal of this project is to utilize High Performance Computing (HPC) develop a model on how various social interactions have influenced the spread of COVID-19 and how they will continue to impact the disease.
We then established a timeline for our project and began investigating the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium and their various projects.
