I investigated an open sorce replication of DeepMind's Alfpafold. 
I also found and examined an open source compition to discover potientially helpful drugs to combat Covid-19.
In this competion, the winners created AIs to generate noval drug molecules and then evaluate these molecules based on how well
they could bind to the novel coronavirus.
These repos were cloned to the Rover server in hopes of analysing thier techniques and applying them to our project.
