This week I have started running perf and other profiling tools on the now-working source codes. At first I was unsure of what type of events I needed to collect.
After further discussion with my mentor, we decided that I should try and find what hardware systems were limiting the performance of the programs.
Also this week, Nia Blake and I gave a presentation to all of our mentor's research students on what we have learned so far about HPC's impact on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
