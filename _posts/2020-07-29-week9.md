title: Week 9
---

My goal for this past week was to analyze both CPU and GPU profiling data that I have collected.
I especially focused on the differences in the CPU metrics gathered when the program was running with and without a GPU.
Interestingly enough, when running with CPU only, the program executed faster, but was far less effecient in its processing than running the program with both he CPU and GPU.
