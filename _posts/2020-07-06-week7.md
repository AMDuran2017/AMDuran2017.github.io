title: Week 7

This week my goal was to get the rest of the source codes up and working. For each of these sorces a new virtual envirnment was created to issolate the individual requirements.
Most of my focus was on working on and understanding the Deep Learning Covid Cure source code created by Matt O'Connor (found here: https://github.com/mattroconnor/deep_learning_coronavirus_cure).
The main reason for this focus is this program showed that Remdisiver was the poteintally good drug to fight COVID-19, and this drug has since been under clinical trails and is showing promissing results to this day.
