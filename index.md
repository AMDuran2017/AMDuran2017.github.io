## About Me

My name is Aaron Duran, I am a rising senior at the Colorado School of Mines. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a speciality in Computer Engineering. In addition to my own academics, I am actively a part of the leadership teams for both the Mines chapter of Christian Challenge as well as the Mines Ballroom Club. I thoroughly enjoy learning about the world that we live in and sharing the knowledge that God has gifted me with others. You may contact me at [amduran@mymail.mines.edu](mailto:amduran@mymail.mines.edu).
